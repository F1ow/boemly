# ðŸŽ¨ Boemly Customizations

Boemly offers a certain amount of customizations. Just enough to be able to use it in every
context/for every brand, but still keep it as simple as possible.

In this document you can learn how to customize Boemly.

## Colors

To customize the colors of the app you can pass the `colors` argument to the `BoemlyThemeProvider`:

```tsx
import { Button, BoemlyThemeProvider } from 'boemly';

const colors = {
  transparent: 'transparent',
  black: '#000000',
  white: '#ffffff',
  primary: {
    50: '#f3f6f5',
    100: '#f2fcf7',
    200: '#d0f2e3',
    300: '#96E3BF',
    400: '#6DD8A6',
    500: '#14C072',
    600: '#13B46C',
    700: '#13A060',
    800: '#108450',
    900: '#0D7748',
  },
};

function App() {
  return (
    <BoemlyThemeProvider colors={colors}>
      <Button>Button</Button>
    </BoemlyThemeProvider>
  );
}

export default App;
```

The customizable colors are `transparent`, `black`, and `white` as standalone colors. Additionally,
`primary`, `gray`, `red`, `orange`, `yellow`, `green`, `teal`, `blue`, `cyan`, `purple`, and `pink`
as color hues from `50` to `900` (as you can see in the example above).
